# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Every member of our community pledges not to participate in and condone discrimination against any individual regardless of their age, appearance, ethnicity, sex, gender, disability, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation or any other grounds.

We pledge to build an open, diverse, inclusive, uplifting and safe community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Respecting every member’s opinions, views and experiences.
- Treat everyone around you with kindness and respect.
- Accepting the collective responsibility to work towards the betterment of the community.
- Being open to feedback and criticism.
- Reporting any incident that violates the Code Of Conduct to the community leader.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Insulting any member of the community.
- Sexual harassment of any form, either online or in person.
- Projecting disrespect or hate towards an individual or a certain group.
- Using the platform provided to promote political ideas or opinions.
- Publishing other’s private information without their permission.

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

Members are responsible for discouraging negative behaviours and encouraging a positive and welcoming community. In case they witness an event or individual which breaches the community code of conduct, they should report the same to the community leader.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
sauravbhise2002@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
